After thinking about it for a long time I finally decided to spend some time into my blog. I have had some ideas on what I wanted to post about: IT, politics, traveling, salsa dancing, mechanics, Venezuela special places and that kind of stuff.

These are many of the interests I pursue which, as you can see, vary a lot.

I will probably start by describing some experiences at work and at some place some some white papers and walk-throughs which might be interesting for one or the other.

At some point I will start describing the places I have been to, the impressions of my travels.

Although this blog is not meant to be private I will post mainly for myself, trying to catch with my everyday life.

Hope you enjoy it!

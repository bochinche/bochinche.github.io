Today I created my first debian (raspbian) repository, which you can find [here](https://github.com/bochinche/ppa). 
Since I am in the process of installing my own home PBX again, I needed to update some packages from the raspbian for asterisk distribution, and replace old dependencies by new ones. 

Check the link, if you want to install asterisk16 on your Pi with raspbian, bullseye. 

best, bochinche

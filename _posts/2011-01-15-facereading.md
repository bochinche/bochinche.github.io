Today I had the opportunity to assist in my first face reading. 
While many may think that this is just another manifestation of superficial esoteric practices, I can say that it was a fantastic experience.

You, the reader, might think, why should I go to a face-reading session, when I could just as well do some serious psychological therapy if I needed to, or just treat myself to some already known personal progress program.

Being a rational person, but also a firm believer in the power of the mind and the subconscious, I would dare to say that your face is not only a mirror of your inner state, but also of the history behind it.

More than deepening the insight into my inner world, I gained a conscience about the path to take in order to improve those aspects of my professional and personal life that are not being lived effectively and how to channel my energy in a more progressive way.

Having said this, I repeat that my experience was very positive, but apart from recommending it, I must advise the reader to inform himself before taking this step, because of the implications it could have.
